Callie was born with a below the right elbow limb difference. Callie has had the strong desire to play ringette since she was 4 years old, from the moment she could talk she was asking for her turn on the ice. As Callie grew, her fondness for ringette grew with her. Throughout her journey her parents and coaches were very creative on how to accommodate her limb difference so she could be success like all her other teammates. Overtime they connected with their Prothesis, Lisa Peters and Keely Brown a renowned Team Canada athlete and coach the ringette community. Collectively they created a product that would not only make Callie feel like all the other players on the ice but help her succeed to become the outstanding goaltender she is today.",
